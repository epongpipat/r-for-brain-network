# gifti_r_network
Manipulate gifti (Surface based brain files) in R to generate network matrices for visualization.

### Prerequisites

* A forked version of the r package [superheat](https://github.com/mychan24/superheat) is used for most of the visualization. Example:

* The [pals](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pals/vignettes/pals_examples.html) package is used for color palette.
* The [gifti](https://github.com/muschellij2/gifti) package is required to read in gifti files. 
* `gridExtra` & `ggplotify` for arranging the plots. 

## Acknowledgments

* The [superheat](https://rlbarter.github.io/superheat/) package was super convenient for my work. Check out the original author's example page.
