# gifti_r_network
Showing how I manipulate gifti (Surface based brain files) in R to generate network matrices for visualization.

### Prerequisites

* A forked version of the r package [superheat](https://github.com/mychan24/superheat) is used for most of the visualization. 
* The [pals](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pals/vignettes/pals_examples.html) package is used for color palette.
* The [gifti](https://github.com/muschellij2/gifti) package is required to read in gifti files. 
* Also, `gridExtra` & `ggplotify` for arranging the plots. 

```
